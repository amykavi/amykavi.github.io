            <p>This is a game created in Scratch. It is a chase game (using the arrow keys) in which you must help Space Doggo eat donuts while avoiding the dinosaur. Once the dog sprite touches the donut, a new donut appears in a random location. The Dinocaur continously glides to random locations on the screen, progressively going faster every 10 seconds. </p>

             <p>This is a quiz app created in MIT App Inventor. It is a fill in the blank vine quiz. Vines are 7 second funny clips that are an essential part of Generation Z culture. Each of the 10 questions in the quiz has a photo of a popular vine as well as a quote from the vine. Using the screen's keyboard, you must type in the correct word in the blank. Our project worked pretty well; All of the questions and photos worked. We could make this project better by having a score tally, adding more questions, and having a final screen that indicates that the quiz has ended. We could also make it more visually appealing by adding more colors and variety. We probably could not sell this quiz game as a product, since most people would not pay for something like a simple, funny quiz. However, if we were to change the topic of the quiz and make it academic, people could buy this app as a way to study for a class or exam.
