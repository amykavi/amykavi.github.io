            <p style="font-size:150%;">This is a game created in Scratch. It is a chase game (using the arrow keys) in which you must help Space Doggo eat donuts while avoiding the dinosaur.<br>Once the dog sprite touches the donut, a new donut appears in a random location. The dinosaur continously glides to random locations on<br>the screen, progressively going faster every 10 seconds. We could have made this project better by adding different levels. For example, maybe the<br>scene would change every time your score increases by 5, or a new element could be added to make the game more interesting.<br>Overall, we learned a lot about Scratch and the basis of programming.</p>

            <p style="font-size:150%;">This is a quiz app created in MIT App Inventor. It is a fill in the blank vine quiz. Vines are 7 second funny clips that are an essential part of Generation Z culture.<br>Each of the 10 questions in the quiz has a photo of a popular vine as well as a quote from the vine. Using the screen's keyboard, you must type in the correct<br>word in the blank. Our project worked pretty well; All of the questions and photos worked. We could make this project better by having a score tally, adding more<br>questions, and having a final screen that indicates that the quiz has ended. We could also make it more visually appealing by adding more colors and variety. We probably could not sell<br>this quiz game as a product, since most people would not pay for something like a simple, funny quiz. However, if we were to change the topic of the quiz and make it academic, people<br>could buy this app as a way to study for a class or exam.
