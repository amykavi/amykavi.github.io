            <p>This is a game I created in Scratch! It is a chase game (using the arrow keys) in which you must help Space Doggo eat donuts while avoiding the dinosaur. Once the dog sprite touches the donut, a new donut appears in a random location. The Dinocaur continously glides to random locations on the screen, progressively going faster every 10 seconds. </p>
